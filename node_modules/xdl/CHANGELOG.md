## [37.0.2] - 2017-04-02

### Added

* When serving manifest over LAN, if request hostname is localhost then
manifest urls also use localhost. This makes it easier to open a project
in simulator when on locked-down wifi.

### Changed

* Fixed download bug.

## [37.0.0] - 2017-03-20

### Added

* Converting RN projects to SDK 15 is now supported.

### Changed

* Eliminated a large class of Flow errors for xdl consumers.
