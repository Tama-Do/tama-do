# Installation with create-react-native-app or Expo

If you are using
[create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
or [Expo](https://expo.io), follow these instructions:

## Step 1: install the package

*Create React Native App* and *Expo* projects include react-native-vector-icons out of the box, so all you need to do
is install react-native-elements.

```
yarn add react-native-elements
```
or

```
npm install react-native-elements
```
