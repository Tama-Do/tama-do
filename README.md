![Pets and Map](/screencaptures/petsMap.gif?raw=true "Pets and Map")

Users receive three virtual pet monsters and place them on a Google Map at locations they need to visit on a regular basis, like the grocery store or the gym. Users can only interact with their pets when they are at the same location as their pet.

![Feeding Pet](/screencaptures/feedingPet.gif?raw=true "Feeding Pet")

Users also have a to-do list. When they complete a task, they receive a treat, which they can feed to their monster. The monster grows a little bit each time it eats a treat.

This project was developed as part of the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy's software engineering immersive program.
